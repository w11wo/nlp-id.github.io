# Token Classification

!!! summary

    _The Token classification task is similar to text classification, except each token within the text receives a prediction. A common use of this task is Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS Tagging)._

| Indonesian RoBERTa Base POSP Tagger | Indonesian RoBERTa Base POSP Tagger is a part-of-speech token-classification model based on the RoBERTa model. The model was originally the pre-trained Indonesian RoBERTa Base model, which is then fine-tuned on indonlu's POSP dataset consisting of tag-labelled news. | Wilson Wongso | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/w11wo/indonesian-roberta-base-posp-tagger) |

| POSP    | This Indonesian part-of-speech tagging (POS) dataset is collected from Indonesian news websites. The dataset consists of around 8000 sentences with 26 POS tags. The POS tag labels follow the Indonesian Association of Computational Linguistics (INACL) POS Tagging Convention.                                                                                                                                           | Devin Hoesen and Ayu Purwarianti                                                                                                                  | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/indonlu) |
| NERP    | This NER dataset (Hoesen and Purwarianti, 2018) contains texts collected from several Indonesian news websites. There are five labels available in this dataset, PER (name of person), LOC (name of location), IND (name of product or brand), EVT (name of the event), and FNB (name of food and beverage). Similar to the TermA dataset, the NERP dataset uses the IOB chunking format.                                    | Devin Hoesen and Ayu Purwarianti                                                                                                                  | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/indonlu) |
| KEPS    | This keyphrase extraction dataset consists of text from Twitter discussing banking products and services and is written in the Indonesian language. A phrase containing important information is considered a keyphrase. Text may contain one or more keyphrases since important phrases can be located at different positions.

| WikiANN | WikiANN (sometimes called PAN-X) is a multilingual named entity recognition dataset consisting of Wikipedia articles annotated with LOC (location), PER (person), and ORG (organisation) tags in the IOB2 format.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Pan, Xiaoman and Zhang, Boliang and May, Jonathan and Nothman, Joel and Knight, Kevin and Ji, Heng & Rahimi, Afshin and Li, Yuan and Cohn, Trevor | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikiann) |
| TermA   | This span-extraction dataset is collected from the hotel aggregator platform, AiryRooms. The dataset consists of thousands of hotel reviews, which each contain a span label for aspect and sentiment words representing the opinion of the reviewer on the corresponding aspect. The labels use Inside-Outside-Beginning (IOB) tagging representation with two kinds of tags, aspect and sentiment.                         | Yosef Ardhito Winatmoko, Ali Akbar Septiandri, Arie Pratama Sutiono & Jordhy Fernando, Masayu Leylia Khodra, Ali Akbar Septiandri                 | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/indonlu) |
